# BasicApp
Clean SAPUI5 template for testing purposes

## Preperations
You need the ui5 CLI to run this app locally. See documentation - https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/

If you don't have it, install it: 
1. Globally npm install --global @ui5/cli
2. In project npm install --save-dev @ui5/cli

I had problems with the local installation in VSCode terminal so I just installed it globally and all works well

## Install

1. clone this repo

2. npm install

## Run locally 

1. run the ui5 cli using command: ui5 serve -o index.html

2. It should open a new webpage automatically in your default browser but if it doesn't, you can access it http://localhost:8080/index.html
